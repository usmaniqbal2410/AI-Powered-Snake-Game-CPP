🐉 AI Snake Game (C++)

This is not your regular Snake Game. It's a C++-based AI Snake Game where you go head-to-head against an intelligent AI snake. The AI doesn’t just chase blindly — it uses smart pathfinding, avoids obstacles, and reacts to your every move. Built using custom data structures and algorithms, this is a logic-focused terminal game designed for fun and learning.
